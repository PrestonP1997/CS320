# CS320

When writing these Junit tests, I made sure that the tests ran with 100% coverage of the class that they were designed to test. Further coverage in other classes bolsters my confidence that the code is secure even further. The tests should include multiple layers of failure/checks to ensure that the code is behavioring as desired. When interpreting user needs, I like
to boil them down to simple bullet points. This way, it is crystal clear what is expected to be made during development. Sometimes if there are unique reuests for code, it is reasonable to reference other applications that may have something similar and improve them. When designing software, I like to take an itterative approach and set small milestones or goals for 
myself. Achieving these goals and reaching these milestones helps me stay focused and motivated, and not worry about how much work is left to do.
